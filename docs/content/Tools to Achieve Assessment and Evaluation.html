students is traditional classroom testing, like pre and post- tests and exams.
However, there are many tools to complete assessment available at our disposal.
Let’s review all of the tools at our disposal.<o:p></o:p>

color:#2D3B45">The above four evaluation types are generally conducted by paper
and pencil tests or computer generated tests. The collection of quantitative
data can provide a lot of information. We use tests be they formal or informal,
to measure an outcome and make sense of that data. This might be  a
standardized test, or a teacher made test. For example a fifty item, multiple
choice history exam. There are a variety of types of tests including;
achievement tests, personality tests, aptitude tests, and ability or intelligence
tests. During this class, we will be focusing in on how to develop achievement
tests.<o:p></o:p>

color:#2D3B45">Achievement tests assess an individual's level of knowledge in a
particular domain, like the history test I mentioned above. Achievement tests
play an important role in the learning environment by determining what a
student has learned and comparing it to what other students know. There are a
variety of types of achievement test. Achievement tests are the most common
test given. These tests can be teacher made, or standardized. Teacher made
tests are constructed by a teacher and the effort made in establishing the
validity and reliability are often non-existent or lacking in their
thoroughness. There's nothing at all wrong with teacher made test they are just
very situation specific and designed to suit a particular teacher’s needs. For
the majority of this class, we will be discussing the creation of teacher-made
tests.  We will discuss standardized tests later in the class.<o:p></o:p>

0in;background:white"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;
color:#2D3B45">However, the most effective means of obtaining data is <strong>observation</strong>
.
Observation is the purpose of collecting evaluative information by performance
based data, for example; reviewing anecdotal records, rating scales, and
checklists, peer appraisals, and self-reporting methods. In this section, we
will review the techniques used by instructors: anecdotal records, rating
scales, and checklists. We will cover self and peer assessments and rubrics in
coming weeks.</span> <o:p></o:p>

<p style="margin-top:9.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.0pt;margin-left:
0in;background:white"><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;
color:#2D3B45"><br/>
<strong>Anecdotal records</strong>
 are
factual descriptions of meaningful incidents and events that the instructor has
observed. The instructional objectives will guide the selection of events and
incidents to record. This is generally useful for disciplinary incidents,
violations, and violations of safety rules. These selections depict actual
behavior in a natural setting. The major problem with these types of
evaluations is their lack of objectivity. It is important to record an incident
as soon as possible. Keep facts and inferences separate. You should try to
record both positive and negative behavioral incidents to show growth as well
as problems. Single incidents rarely indicate a pattern of behavior, so it is
better to observe the person for more than one incident before making any
inferences about his or her behavior.<br/>
<br/>
The use of <strong>rating
scales</strong>
 provides systematic procedures for reporting the
observer’s judgments. Usually, the rating scale consists of a set of
characteristics or qualities to be judged and some type of scale is made in
conjunction with the instructional objectives so that instructors can observe
specific behaviors. The rating scale will also provide a common frame of
reference for comparing all students on the same set of characteristics. This
common frame provides a convenient method for recording observer’s judgments.
Rating scales are useful in evaluating learning outcomes associated with
procedures, products, or personal/social development. However, you should be
aware that rating scales have a tendency to inflate scores. Conversely, it is
conceivable that you would rate everyone severely low. Another common
occurrence is to rate everyone average or what is called central tendency
error. Subjectivity on the part of the evaluator may affect the entire rating
as high or low depending on the general impression of the evaluator towards the
entire evaluation process. There are several points of consideration regarding
the effective use of rating scales. The items being observed are directly
related to the instructional objectives. Therefore, if objectives are written
properly, it becomes easy to identify performances using the rating scale. The
rating scale must confine items to those directly observable. The characteristics
should be clearly defined. When you evaluate using a rating scale, you should
omit characteristics you feel you are not qualified to judge. If possible,
ratings from several evaluators should be combined to arrive at a common
rating.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Checklists </strong>
are
similar to rating scales, but they just call for a yes or no rather than a
degree of frequency of the item selected. Most checklists focus on procedures
and processes rather than the end result. Evaluating performance skills that
can be divided into a series of specific actions can be accomplished using a
checklist.<br/>
You may find that by involving your students in developing and using rating
scales and checklists, and holding follow-up individual conferences, the
students better understand instructional objectives, recognize their progress
toward the objectives, and diagnose their own strengths and weaknesses. This
process helps students learn how to diagnose their own performance.<o:p></o:p>

<span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#2D3B45"> are performance
assessment that used to determine if a student is able to show their learning.
In this way, it is an assessment by the teacher of the students “authentic
work”. (Taylor, 2008). These include a variety of activities including products
and live performances.  Products might include things like; 1) written
reports, reflections, mathematical models, websites, paintings. Live
performances might include things like; 1) speeches, presentations, musical
performance, athletic performance, scientific investigations, debates. These
performance assessments include specific rules for scoring (evaluating) the
performance and or the product of the performance.  These rules can be set
up into a rubric. This rubric should be a systematic scoring of the rules.<o:p></o:p>
