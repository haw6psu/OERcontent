<h3><span class="MsoHyperlink">Appraisal</span><o:p></o:p>

color:#2D3B45">Assessing students for </span><strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;
color:#2D3B45">appraisal </span></strong>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;
color:#2D3B45">purposes looks at student performance before entry into an
instructional sequence. This is sometimes called “Training Needs Assessment”.
For example, when you test prospective students for entry into the program, the
exam is considered to be an appraisal instrument to decide who is eligible for
enrollment. This data may include the student’s present knowledge level,
present skill level, prerequisite performance, and capabilities such as math
and reading, as well as personality factors. By examining the data, you would
be able to identify present student needs and status, and point out where
instruction should begin and the direction it should take. These exams could
also predict the success of students with a given level of aptitude. By
analyzing the entry level of the incoming students, you can tailor your program
to meet them where they are and take them to the level you desire for them to
be successful apprentices.<o:p></o:p>

<h3>Diagnosis<o:p></o:p>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top:9.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.0pt;margin-left:
0in;background:white"><strong><span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;color:#2D3B45">Diagnosis</span></strong>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#2D3B45"> is similar to
appraisal, but it deals with the assessment of the students during the
instruction. It is used to determine any difficulties or deficiencies arising
during the learning period. Diagnostic materials may be administered to a group
or an entire class, but the diagnosis is then used to apply remediation
individually in the form of changes to the instruction to meet the needs of
students. After the completion of a learning sequence, remediation allows
specific teaching to overcome deficiencies identified via diagnosis. Effective
teaching requires that you understand the learning process, including the principles
of learning, learning styles, and the impact of physical, psychological, and
social handicaps on the learning process. You also need to know how to apply
diagnostic techniques during training. By using different diagnostic techniques
during the learning process, you will be able to make adjustments in your
program to correct any problems that may occur.<o:p></o:p>

<h3>Formative Evaluation<o:p></o:p>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top:9.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.0pt;margin-left:

mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;color:#2D3B45">Formative evaluation</span></strong>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#2D3B45"> is the third
purpose of assessment. This method of educational assessment is conducted on
small bodies of content, or on a specific skill for the purpose of determining
if the intended objectives have been attained. Decisions about further
instruction or revisions to instruction can be based on the results of the
formative evaluation that indicate the success or failure of the preceding
instruction. The identification of the effectiveness of the instructional
process is usually done throughout the training program. The number of
questions in the evaluation is determined by the amount or size of the instructional
block being measured. Testing for formative evaluation purposes should occur
frequently, and may cover material from one lesson, a chapter in a textbook, or
material covered over a specified period of time. If the majority of the
students do poorly in the evaluation for a specific unit, the instructional
sequence or strategy needs to be adjusted. If only a few students do poorly,
individualized remediation can address the situation.<o:p></o:p>

<h3>Summative Evaluation<o:p></o:p>
</h3>

mso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;color:#2D3B45">Summative evaluation</span></strong>
<span style="font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;color:#2D3B45"> is defined as a
final evaluation of a substantial part of, or all of, the course. It is used to
determine if the learner has achieved the ultimate instructional objectives
established in advance. These methods report a student’s overall achievement.
The data from a summative evaluation can be used to assess the effectiveness of
the overall instructional program. Were the objectives obtainable by the
students and were the objectives defined clearly enough to serve as measures of
achievement? These two questions are usually asked when conducting summative
evaluations. Licensing or certification is a type of summative.<o:p></o:p>
